# Weeknotes Principles

Key principles and philosophy from Giles Turnbull's weeknotes methodology. Reference this for deeper understanding of what makes weeknotes effective.

## The Core Purpose

Weeknotes act as a broadcast mechanism. They give teams and individuals a voice for communicating with stakeholders about the things that matter to both parties.

**The goal isn't writing a weeknote - it's becoming the sort of team that habitually writes weeknotes.** When missing one feels weird, the habit has taken hold.

## The Three Rules

When weeknotes are adopted across an organization:

1. **Every team must write regular notes** - Weekly ideally, monthly minimum
2. **No individual is required to read every note** - Readers choose focus
3. **All weeknotes must be accessible** - Published where everyone can see them

These rules create organizational superpowers:
- Teams can broadcast without booking meetings
- Leaders can focus attention where needed
- Silos become transparent (windows in the walls)

## Why Weeknotes Succeed or Fail

**Weeknotes succeed when:**
- Teams write their own notes without editorial interference
- There's no rigid template everyone must follow
- Notes are published by the writer, not a third party
- Notes are accepted for what they are, not quality-controlled

**Weeknotes fail when:**
- Every note must be checked by comms department
- Notes are ghost-written by professionals outside the team
- Middle management secretly edits out bad news
- Only one person can publish to the platform
- There are barriers that slow down sharing

## The "Aim Low" Philosophy

A common mistake is putting enormous effort into weeknotes - hours of writing, multiple contributors, lots of anguish. This kills the habit quickly.

Instead:
- Make it a small task, not a big task
- Spend less time making them
- Let them be rougher round the edges
- Keep them short
- Make them lightweight, skimmable, disposable

**If you're spending more than 30 minutes on a weeknote, you're spending too long.**

## Write As the Week Goes

Gather fragments throughout the week rather than reconstructing everything on Friday:
- Set up a dedicated channel (#weeknotes-notes)
- Anyone can drop thoughts, links, images, notes at any time
- The Friday writer plunders the channel for material
- Not everything from the channel needs to make the note

This makes Friday writing faster and involves the whole team.

## Radiating Intent

Weeknotes are an excellent tool for radiating intent: "Don't ask permission; radiate intent."

Over time, stakeholders expect weeknotes to signal what's coming next. The weeknote becomes an invitation to intervene: "This is what we're planning. If you want us to change course, say so!"

This can include explicit feedback loops: "Reply to this note if you have concerns - otherwise we'll assume you're happy with this plan."

## What Weeknotes Can Achieve

### A Tool for Remembering
- Teams forget what they've done over time
- Weeknotes turn remembering into a deliberate, funded activity
- Archived weeknotes become a time machine for decisions and context
- Linkable history has compounding value

### A Tool for Recruiting
- Good public weeknotes show what your team is really like
- Candidates can see if they'd fit before applying
- Applicants who quote your weeknotes in interviews are well-prepared

### A Tool for Seeing Through Silos
- Weeknotes cut windows in organizational silos
- Anyone can peer inside to see what's happening
- Reduces the need for information-gathering meetings
- Helps colleagues understand: "Ahhhh. So that's what this lot have been up to."

## Writing Style Tips

**Structure:**
- Don't worry about chronological order - order by importance
- Lead with the most important thing
- Use bullet points rather than prose
- 10 bullets is plenty, 3 is enough

**Tone:**
- Don't overthink it - off-the-cuff reads better
- No need for clever introductions or formal arguments
- Allow thoughts and feelings to creep in alongside news
- Be open, candid, refreshingly honest
- It's not an essay - don't write like you did at university

**For Leaders:**
- Write your own weeknotes, don't delegate
- It's a precious opportunity to speak directly to your team
- The more personal, the more people will read it

## Handling Emotions

If weeknotes feel like a burden, something's wrong:
- They've become elevated beyond their purpose
- Too much pressure as a reporting/governance tool
- The best notes are genuine personal reflections

If someone is stressed about weeknotes from Tuesday onwards, the system needs adjusting.

## Buddy Checking

Built-in quick review before publishing:
- A second pair of eyes for errors and typos
- Quick and informal, not a chore
- If your buddy complains it takes too long, your note is probably too long
- Take turns being each other's buddy

## Examples of Effective Weeknotes

Real examples that demonstrate good practice:
- **BFI Archive**: Behind-the-scenes glimpses, curated short texts
- **House of Commons Library**: Long, text-heavy but entertainingly written with running gags
- **Natural Resources Wales**: Team-specific but public, attracted job applicants who'd read along

Using humor is a deliberate tactic - it helps busy stakeholders make time to read.

## When There's Not Much to Say

Not every week is news-packed:
- It's fine to note "it's been one of those weeks"
- Five photos can be the whole note
- Skipping a week occasionally is acceptable
- Slow weeks are still worth documenting (context for later)

## The Long-Term Value

One weeknote is useful. An archive of hundreds of weeknotes is a fabulous repository:
- Decisions and their rationale
- How problems were overcome
- Commitments made and why
- Historical context for current situations

This investment compounds over time. The more history, the more valuable.
